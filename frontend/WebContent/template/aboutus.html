<h2 align="center" class="style2">Who  we are?</h2>
<p align="center" class="style2">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="justify" class="style1">We are a group of  enthusiastic youths with a vision to bring new and productive forms of  communication services. We aim to make this service available to as many people  possible and connect everyone of them at once, in order to collect the madness  from all over the world under the same roof. If you are a 90s kid, you must  have remembered the fun that we used to have at chat rooms every day after  school. Today, chat rooms are almost abandoned because of lack of proper  maintainance. We are reviving the old school &quot;chat rooms&quot; that were  hosted on IRC, yahoo messenger(TM), Nimbuzz(TM), MSN(TM) and are no longer  available/maintained/working. We have created this lightweight website version  of the traditional chatrooms and facilitated it with modern chat app  facilities. You can share photos, youtube videos, initiate a private chat with  anybody at anytime without revealing your personal information. All that you  need to use TNC is a nickname which you can dispose whenever you like by  pressing the 'Log Out' button. People are using yesichat to make friends, many  have found their dream partner, many have got red eyes and computer vision  syndrome due to over addiction to the elegance and simplicity of TNC. Its a platform  with freedom to do whatever you like.TNC is using TNC chat  software which is available for interested webmasters. For any suggestions/  feature requests/ proposals you may reach us at&nbsp;contact@tnc.in<br />
  Regards- Team TNC</p>
